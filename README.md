# Learning Lab

Welcome to the starting point of our GitHub learning journey. This repository
contains a minimal single-page HTML app that we will evolve step by step while
exploring workflows, tooling, and best practices.

## How to run

1. Open `index.html` directly in your browser to see the current page.
2. Prefer a local server? From the project root run `npx serve .` (or any
   simple static server) and visit the printed URL.

## Getting started

1. Follow the steps in **How to run** so you can preview changes as you work.
2. Make small, focused changes so each commit tells a clear story.
3. Use the README to document new commands, tips, or concepts that you learn
   along the way.

## Next steps

- Decide on the first topic you would like to explore.
- Create an issue or jot down notes about what you plan to change.
- Commit and push your improvements, then iterate again.

## Notes widget tips

- Capture ideas with the `Type a note...` field and use **Clear Notes** beneath the list to remove everything in one click when you want a fresh start.

Let the experimentation begin!
